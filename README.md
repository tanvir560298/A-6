#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

1. Var is a type of variable which value can be updated or changed. We can use the var anywhere in the fucntion.
let is similar to the var cause its value can also be changed by the user where as the constant value can not be changed once we assign it a value we cannot change it otherwise we get an error.

2. map() is used to transfrom each array into a new array. it creates a new array with the result it gets and this map() function return us an array.

foreach() is a loop that we normally use when we need to perform some task in a array. It does not return anything

filter() works same as if. It help up to set a condition on a array and based on that condition we get a new array where the elemets of the array abides by the condition that we wanted to provide to it

3. arrow function in ES6 is just a shorter way to write javascript fucntion. For writing this function we use =>.

4. Destructuring assignment in ES6 is a way to extract values from arrays or objects into variables easily without accessing them one by one.

5. Template literals in ES6 is a way to create strings. If also helps us to make the content of the string dynamic we can provide the value of a variable in the string if we use the `` it allows us to assign the varibale using ${}. For that we easily get the dyanamic values.
